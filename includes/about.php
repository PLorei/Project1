          I am a senior Computer Science major at the <a href="http://pitt.edu" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>. 
          I am the second oldest of 5 siblings ranging in age from 24 to 12.
          Originally from Philadelphia (avid Sixers fan here), I spent my freshman year at Purdue University before deciding I needed to become a Panther. 
          I did 3 co-op rotations doing software engineering with 
          <a href="http://www.selectinternational.com/" target="_blank">Select International</a> and really enjoyed the experience.
          I'd highly recommend doing co-op to all underclassmen as it allows you to learn industry-applicable skills prior to graduation.
          Most of my programming experience is in web development, and I enjoy working in C# and Java, as well as 
          doing front end work in JavaScript, JQuery and NodeJS. I also work as the online editor of the school newspaper: 
          <a href="http://pittnews.com" target="_blank">The Pitt News</a>.
          I'm a huge music fan. My favorite acts are Florence + The Machine, Bonobo, Dipset, Neyo, The Gorillaz, Heatmakerz, Kanye West, Toro y Moi, Phantogram, Future, and Clams Casino.
          I'm currently working on a music blog <a href="http://juiceboxfresh.us" target="_blank">JuiceBox</a> with some buddies from my freshman year.
          Outside of programming I enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and making beats on Apple's Logic Pro X.
